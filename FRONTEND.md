Flutter web app skeleton with Ferry GraphQL client. Implement circuit editor interface.

## What's Provided

- Flutter app with Material 3 theme
- Ferry GraphQL client with code generation
- Basic GraphQL operations and sample UI

## Project Structure

```

## Development Setup

```bash
flutter pub get      # Install dependencies
task dev             # Run Flutter web app
task generate        # Generate GraphQL code from schema
```

## Ferry GraphQL Integration

Client configured in `lib/graphql_client.dart`. Ferry generates type-safe Dart code from `.graphql` files.

Sample usage in `lib/test_query.dart`:

```dart
Operation(
  client: client,
  operationRequest: GGetCircuitsReq(),
  builder: (context, response, error) {
    // Handle loading, error, and data states
  },
)
```

Run `task generate` after modifying `.graphql` query documents to update generated code.
